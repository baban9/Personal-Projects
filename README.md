# Personal-Projects

From Basic python to Data cleaning to classification to generating images and classifying images and next words. This repository entails mini projects which has encompassed all aforementioned domains small implementations. 

This further bolsters the emphasis on 
-  Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning
    - [Sentiment Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/baban9/Personal-Projects/blob/master/Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb) - Sentiment analysis refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information

    - [TextRank Text Summarization.ipynb](https://github.com/baban9/Personal-Projects/blob/master/Summarizing%20the%20data%20-%20TextRank.ipynb) & [Feature Based summarization](https://github.com/baban9/Personal-Projects/blob/master/%20Feature-based%20text%20summarization.ipynb)- Automatic summarization is the process of shortening a set of data computationally, to create a subset that represents the most important or relevant information within the original content. In addition to text, images and videos can also be summarized.

    - Text Analysis ( data cleaning and visualization) - A novel approach in understand the nuances of words 

    - [Informational Retrieval.ipynb](https://github.com/baban9/Personal-Projects/blob/master/Information%20retrieval%20.ipynb) - Information retrieval is the process of obtaining information system resources that are relevant to an information need from a collection of those resources. Searches can be based on full-text or other content-based indexing.

    - [Resume Matching.ipynb](https://github.com/baban9/Personal-Projects/blob/master/Resume%20matching%20.ipynb) & [editing.ipynb](https://github.com/baban9/Personal-Projects/blob/master/Resume%20editing%20.ipynb) ( 2 differnt notebooks) - A Machine learning approach in increasing chances of beating the ATS system via resume and job description matching and eventually attaining 80+% match to ascertain the first interview round. Also, Text summarizing techniwues are used to answer "Tell me about yourself" a notoriously famous question during interviewing process. This method summarizes the resume ( or could job description) and saying that will yield in another round, maybe. :) 

    - [Predicting the Next word.ipynb](https://github.com/baban9/Personal-Projects/blob/master/Predicting%20next%20Word%20LSTM%20.ipynb) - Utilized 1 hidden layer to predict the next word given the random dataset of Spam and ham classification of emails. Trained on 15 epochs only, yet the results were promising. 

    - [Chat generator.ipynb](https://github.com/baban9/Personal-Projects/blob/master/chat%20generator.ipynb) - This is further continuation of next word prediction. Utilized personal chats to train a RNN model to generate a fitting reply to a group of 10 people. Even though the dataset is small, 1000 replies, the trained model gained significant improvement with only 200 epochs.<1>

- Computer Vision and Neural Networks 
    - [Generative Adversarial Networks.ipynb](https://github.com/baban9/Personal-Projects/blob/master/GANs.ipynb) - A generative adversarial network is a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. Two neural networks contest with each other in a game. Given a training set, this technique learns to generate new data with the same statistics as the training set. Generated Hand written digits through the MNIST data. 

    - [Image Classification.ipynb](https://github.com/baban9/Personal-Projects/blob/master/X_ray_pneumonia.ipynb) - Utilized the X-ray dataset to work on classification of patient chest X-rays in to pneumonia or normal condition. Utilized Specificity metrics to make a jugdement call and a second opinion for the doctors. 

- Machine Leaning 
    - [MultiClass.ipynb](https://github.com/baban9/Personal-Projects/blob/master/Classification%20-%20multilclass.ipynb) and [Binary Classification.ipynb](https://github.com/baban9/Personal-Projects/blob/master/Classification%20using%20Neural%20Network.ipynb) - Classify consumer complaints into the product category it belongs to using the description of the complaint.

    - [FIFA team prediction and Budgeting.ipynb](https://github.com/baban9/Personal-Projects/blob/master/Fifa%20team%20prediction%20and%20budgeting.ipynb) - A binary classification of player within above the threshold performers and lelow it. Further extension delas with selecting the player from good ratings to be recruited into the club given the budget constraints and buckets they fall into.

    - [Document Clustering.ipynb](https://github.com/baban9/Personal-Projects/blob/master/Clustering%20Documents.ipynb) - Document clustering, also called text clustering, is a cluster analysis on textual documents. One of the typical usages would be document management.

    - [Outlier Analysis.ipyb](https://github.com/baban9/Personal-Projects/blob/master/Outlier%20analysis.ipynb) - As we begin working with data, we (generally always) observe that there are few errors in the data, like missing values, outliers, no proper formatting, etc. In nutshell, we call them inconsistency. This consistency, more or less, skews the data and hamper the Machine learning algorithms to predict correctly. In this article, we will try to see how outliers affect the accuracy of machine learning algorithm and how scaling would have helped or affected our learning. Used 2 non-parametric algorithms, k-NN and Decision Trees for the simplicity of the objective.
